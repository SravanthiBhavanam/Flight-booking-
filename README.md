To develop a flight ticket booking web application based on the specified user requirements, you can leverage the following tech stack:

Frontend:

HTML5: Utilized as a markup language to structure web pages.
CSS3: Employed as a styling language for crafting an appealing user interface.
JavaScript: Implemented as a programming language to enable client-side interactivity.

Backend:

Node.js: Leveraged as a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
Express.js: Utilized as a web application framework for Node.js, facilitating route handling and request management.
MongoDB: Deployed as a NoSQL database to store user and flight-related information.
Authentication and Authorization:

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Adopted as a token-based authentication and authorization system.
Additional Tools and Libraries:

Mongoose: Employed as a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
bcrypt: Integrated as a library to facilitate password hashing and verification.
Moment.js: Utilized as a library to handle date parsing, validation, manipulation, and formatting.
Bootstrap: Utilized as a CSS framework that supports responsive and mobile-first web development.
Below is a suggested directory structure for your project:

- project-root
  |- backend
  |    |- node_modules
  |    |- controllers
  |    |- models
  |    |- routes
  |    |- utils
  |    |- app.js
  |    |- package.json
  |    |- ...
  |
  |- frontend
       |- index.html
       |- styles.css
       |- scripts.js
       |- ...



       
The backend directory should contain the server-side code responsible for handling requests and interacting with the database. The controllers directory can house functions to handle various user and admin use cases. The models directory can define the database schema using Mongoose. The routes directory can contain API routes for different endpoints. The utils directory can comprise helper functions or utilities.

Within the frontend directory, you'll find the HTML file (index.html) responsible for the user interface, the CSS file (styles.css) for styling, and the JavaScript file (scripts.js) for client-side interactivity
